# 1st ever terraform lab
Terraform lab made during my internship at Omegapoint.

Nothing special or fancy at all - this is simply to get started and get a feel of what Terraform can do and how to use it!

The goal was to build an Azure environment that replicates the picture below using only Terraform;

*limited access so not available to do certain things like creating subscriptions etc*
